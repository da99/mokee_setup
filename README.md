2) GApps - use Pico package only. Best to install as few apps as possible in /system,
     even GMail and Google Dialer.


3) Wipe Caches (Cache,Dalvik)


If GApps stop working after OTA update, then re-install GApps (pico):
  1) Remove, re-add Google Account
  2) Re-install GApps:
     Install absolut minimum through Aroma.
     Download MD5 checksum file.
     Wipe Cache, Dalvik after Aroma GApps.
